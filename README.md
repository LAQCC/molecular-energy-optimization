## Introduction

In this study, we performed a quantum algorithm to find the ground state of protocatechuic acid (PCA), derived from benzoic acid and characterized by the molecular formula $C_{7}H_{6}O_{4}$ with chemical name 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. 

We are based on the study carried out by Wassil Sennane, Jean-Philip Piquemal, and Marko J. Rančić,  "Calculating the Ground State Energy of Benzene Under Spatial Deformations with Noisy Quantum Computing". For more details, refer to the full article available in the link below.

## Notebooks
For the simulations carried out in this work, five HE ansatz circuits were considered. The first three are ansatz (v1, v2, v3) used in reference (Sennane et al., 2023) to calculate the ground state of benzene molecule. The V4 was proposed considering changes in the rotations of the ansatz V1. The v5 is a ansatz proposed in this work considering the coupling of qubits in the HOMO layer.
